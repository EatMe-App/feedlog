# Widget configuration and display controls

Install the [Widget SDK](https://github.com/linkcraftstudio/feedlog-widget) in
your product and configure it with your FeedLog workspace URL. The dashboard's
Widget settings page provides installation examples, launcher defaults and
assistant settings.

## Dashboard settings

The enable switch saves immediately. Feedback button and assistant settings each have
their own **Save changes** and **Cancel changes** actions. Editing a rule updates
the assistant draft; save that section to apply it. Failed saves retain the draft.

Launcher placement defaults to the right side, 20px from the bottom and side.
Desktop and mobile share these settings; the SDK adds device safe-area insets.
Offsets have no fixed pixel limit. The SDK and preview keep the button within
their viewport without changing the configured values.
**Reset position** changes the placement draft only. Save it to apply the reset;
the selected closing behavior and visitor preferences remain unchanged.

| Closing behavior | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Do not allow closing | No launcher close button. |
| Collapse to a Help tab | A small tab stays against the screen edge. This is the default. Clicking it restores the button and opens feedback. |
| Hide for now | The launcher disappears until the page reloads or the SDK is reinitialized. |

The preview supports dragging, opening, closing and resetting the launcher. It
uses the current draft and does not create conversations or save visitor state.

## Configuration API

`GET /api/widget/config` is public and returns:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "allowGuest": false,
  "org": { "name": "Acme", "logo": null },
  "branding": { "primary": "#C45A46", "primaryForeground": "#FFFFFF" },
  "launcher": {
    "alignment": "right",
    "bottomOffset": 20,
    "sideOffset": 20,
    "closeBehavior": "collapse"
  }
}
```

`allowGuest` follows the workspace's guest-posting setting. Branding and identity
come from the workspace; the foreground color is calculated from its brand color.

`GET /api/admin/widget` and `PATCH /api/admin/widget` require the
`feedlog:moderate` permission. The admin API uses `launcherConfig` for the same
four launcher properties. A launcher update sends the complete object:

```json
{
  "launcherConfig": {
    "alignment": "left",
    "bottomOffset": 32,
    "sideOffset": 24,
    "closeBehavior": "hide"
  }
}
```

Alignment must be `left` or `right`; offsets must be non-negative safe integers;
closing behavior must be `none`, `collapse` or `hide`. Invalid or incomplete
objects return HTTP 400. Omit `launcherConfig` to leave it unchanged. Each update
writes only the submitted settings fields. Rule-count validation and the update
run under the same row lock so concurrent saves cannot bypass the rule limit.

## Storage and upgrades

Migration `0015_widget_launcher_config` adds one non-null JSONB column,
`organization_widget.launcher_config`, with the right/20/20/collapse object as
its default. Validation is handled by the application. Existing workspace
settings are preserved; a workspace with no settings row uses the same defaults.
Run `pnpm migrate` as part of upgrading a self-hosted instance.

Visitor positions and button/tab preferences are stored in the host page's
`sessionStorage`, scoped by FeedLog URL. They survive reloads within that tab.
Fully hidden state is kept only in memory. None of these preferences is written
to the organization settings table.

## Host integration

Explicit SDK placement overrides dashboard defaults. A visitor's dragged
position takes priority over both. Dragging docks the launcher to the nearest
left or right edge; the feedback panel chooses a position within the viewport.

The SDK exports `createWidget`, `openWidget`, `closeWidget` and `updateWidget`.
Use `updateWidget({ theme, launcher, zIndex })` for partial display updates.
Launcher `state` is `button`, `tab` or `hidden`; hiding the launcher does not
close the panel or prevent a custom help entry from calling `openWidget()`.
Explicit runtime position updates replace a saved drag. Other updates retain it.

The default z-index is 40, allowing host dialogs to cover the widget. Override it
when your application's layer scale differs. Close the panel with `closeWidget()`
when a business dialog needs room; launcher visibility is controlled separately.

Promise-based `auth.login` hides the widget until the interaction exits and
identity is checked again. Synchronous callbacks remain visible and require no
completion signal, preserving SDK 0.0.6 behavior.

Live theme updates require an iframe that advertises theme support. The SDK keeps
an older frame's current theme instead of reloading and losing its draft. Initial
theme selection remains compatible through the iframe URL parameter.

Restoring a conversation draft, attachments and reading position across sign-in
requires matching SDK and hosted iframe support. Resume messages validate the
parent/frame origin and source; a different signed-in account cannot inherit
the previous account's state. See the [SDK integration guide](https://github.com/linkcraftstudio/feedlog-widget#host-login-lifecycle)
for examples and compatibility details.
